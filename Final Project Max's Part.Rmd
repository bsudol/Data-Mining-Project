###################Search for and Mark Dishonesty####
#In this section we search for and mark possible dishonesty in answering the survey. First we search for people who might have answered the questions randomly. Here we look for people who are very distanced from the mean response for each question. We marked people who were more than two standard deviations away from from the "average response" when you add how far away they were from the average response for each question. Secondly we look for people who answered the survey with the same response over and over again. We take the mode of their responses and check to see how large it is. If they answered the survey over 90% with the same answer, then they are marked. There is no way to know for sure if they actually were dishonest in answering, however this could be a strong prediction to remove dishonest responses from the dataset for future analysis

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
